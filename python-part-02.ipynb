      "To make a function, you start with `def`. It means define. Then you provide the name of your function, a set of parentheses for any arguments, and a colon. The \"body\" of the function (that is the code that it will encapsulate) is then indented, just like a conditional. The indentation is part of the language remember. When the function is over, you unindent. It helps a lot when reading the code - you can see where your functions start and skim over the rest.\n",
